Here I'm going to be attempting to link the circles file that Rayan sent me to the serratus / logan DB. More specifically, Artem wants me to determine which SRRs correspond to a yeast sample and which dont. Basically, 
I'm adding a T/F value to each SRR. How am I going to do this? no clue... but I know where to start. 

1. I need to extract the headers from the file that Rayan sent me. They're gonna be broken down into a table in the follwing manner:
| SRR | CONTIG | ka | g | y | 

the OG file is structured like: 

>DRR000001_40_circle_40 ka:f:78.719 L:-:40:- L:+:40:+
CCACAACCGTACTGCCGATTCGCTTCCTCAACGATTAATTTATTATGATAAGCAATTTTTAAAGACCTACGCCACGCACACATCGGGCATAACCTCACTTTACAAAACTGAGCTTGATACAACTTTAATTTGCCCGTCTCCGGGTCTCGTTTAAACGAAAGACATTCCGCACAACTGCACAATTTCTCAGCTTTTTTGCCATAGTAAGGTA

Keeping the basic zst decomp command here for reference 

zstd -dc file.fa.zst | less 
                        ^
                        |
                    this part can be modified 

So basically what I want to do is to use an AWK script that artem sent to rip out the headers, run them against the SRR that Jess sent then remake a table with the T/F value alongside each one.
'''

awk 'BEGIN{
  OFS="\t";
  print "SRR","CONTIG","KA","G","Y"
}
{
  s = $0

  # SRR: from char 2 (after ">") up to first "_"
  p1 = index(s, "_")
  srr = (p1>0) ? substr(s, 2, p1-2) : ""

  # CONTIG: number after "circle_"
  cp = index(s, "circle_")
  if (cp>0) {
    rest = substr(s, cp + 7)
    split(rest, a, /[^0-9]/)
    contig = a[1]
  } else contig = ""

  # KA: number after "ka:f:"
  kp = index(s, "ka:f:")
  if (kp>0) {
    restk = substr(s, kp + 5)
    split(restk, b, /[^0-9.]/)
    ka = b[1]
  } else ka = ""

  # G: from first "L:" (inclusive) to end of line
  gp = index(s, "L:")
  g = (gp>0) ? substr(s, gp) : ""

  print srr, contig, ka, g
}' input.txt > output.tsv
'''

--------------------- Update 1 --------------------------------------
Artem now wants me to add hits against yeast and C. elegans to the tsv file that I generated with that AWK command. 

Script to do it 

awk 'BEGIN {OFS="\t"}
     NR==FNR {srr[$1]=1; next}
     FNR==1 {print $1,$2,$3,$4,$5,"yeast"; next}
     { print $1,$2,$3,$4,$5,($1 in srr ? 1 : 0) }'   <(zstdcat sra_taxid.csv.zst | grep -F "Saccharomyces" | cut -d',' -f1 | tr -d '"')   yeast.circles.tsv > circles.yeast.labeled.tsv

For C.elegans

awk 'BEGIN {OFS="\t"}
     NR==FNR {srr[$1]=1; next}
     FNR==1 {print $1,$2,$3,$4,$5,$6, "C. elegans"; next}
     { print $1,$2,$3,$4,$5,($1 in srr ? 1 : 0) }'   <(zstdcat sra_taxid.csv.zst | grep -F "Caenorhabditis elegans" | cut -d',' -f1 | tr -d '"')   circles.yeast.labeled.tsv > circles.dual.labled.tsv

Huge hits on these. Output file containing both C.elegans and yeast is called circles.dual.labeled.tsv and is stored on The world (instance)



---------- Fuck up 1 ------------------------------

So uh. That script artem gave me may have slightly botched everything and spat out the G column with 2 different data points in it instead of 1, and none in the Y column. This has been causing 
issues when I try to extract the data... 

So I'm just gonna rip out the G column lol. 

```
cut -f1-3 your_file.tsv > output_file.tsv
```

Done. now I just need to rerun the above scripts targeted to the correct columns. 

Hits look good based on grep-ing of them. Using a script (shotgun.sh) to append the yeast / C elegans hits to my original Uclust output file. 

------- Shotgun.sh script ------------------------------------------------

#!/bin/bash

# Input files
UNCOMPRESSED=$1
COMPRESSED=$2

# Create lookup table from compressed file
TMP_LOOKUP=$(mktemp)
zstd -d -c "$COMPRESSED" | awk '{print $1 "\t" $4 "\t" $5}' > "$TMP_LOOKUP"

# Process uncompressed file and append organism flags
awk -v LOOKUP="$TMP_LOOKUP" '
BEGIN {
    # Load lookup table into associative array
    while ((getline line < LOOKUP) > 0) {
        split(line, parts, "\t")
        yeast_flags[parts[1]] = parts[2]
        celeg_flags[parts[1]] = parts[3]
    }
    close(LOOKUP)
}
{
    # Extract SRR from column 9 (everything before first "_")
    split($9, a, "_")
    srr_id = a[1]
    
    # Get flags from lookup, default to 0 if not found
    yeast_flag = (srr_id in yeast_flags) ? yeast_flags[srr_id] : 0
    celeg_flag = (srr_id in celeg_flags) ? celeg_flags[srr_id] : 0
    
    # Print original line with appended flags
    print $0 "\t" yeast_flag "\t" celeg_flag
}
' "$UNCOMPRESSED"

# Clean up temp file
rm "$TMP_LOOKUP"
# run with ./shotgun.sh comparison input > output

--------- Shotgun.sh results -----------------------

Results look good. zstdcat | head of the file pulls up linked hits, and a grep of known yeast hits pulls up the following 

S       240252  80      *       .       *       *       *       DRR342982_4136_circle_4136_3 [882 - 643] (REVERSE SENSE) ka:f:132.393 L:-:4136:+        *       1       0

C.elegans grep pulls up

S       1456583 80      *       .       *       *       *       DRR142764_162086_circle_162086_1 [115 - 354] (ORF crosses the breakpoint) ka:f:6.484 L:-:162086:- L:+:162086:+  *       0      1
S       1456584 165     *       .       *       *       *       DRR142764_106600_circle_106600_2 [2 - 495] (ORF crosses the breakpoint) ka:f:8.414 L:-:106600:- L:+:106600:+    *       0      1
S       3406741 165     *       .       *       *       *       DRR142764_106600_circle_106600_1 [1 - 495] (ORF crosses the breakpoint) ka:f:8.414 L:-:106600:- L:+:106600:+    *       0      1

Binary hits work on both. We're in business.

-------- Extracting target data for alignment -------------

Oh yeah we still need to realign and recluster LOL

Converted my .UC file to a tsv for ease of processing (I would like to talk to robert edgar about his choice of delimiters in Uclust....). Polymorph.py was the script used. 

I then used an R script to break apart the original Uclust file into files with yeast hits, C.elegans hits and neither. Grouping was based on cluster number, and if even one cluster member pulled a 
hit for yeast or worms, the entire cluster was pulled. Side note, while I was glancing through the data I noted cluster 10044. Lots of non-yeast hits clustered around a yeast hit. need to mark it as
high priority. 

Output of the R script 

|==================================================|

Second <int> is what we care about. 

I think the "both" output is a little redundant since I doubt we would have a similar virus / viroid in both species given how distant they are, but I'm keeping it just in case. 

Time to start analysing (see DF11).
